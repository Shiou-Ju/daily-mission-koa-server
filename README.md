# Principle: 1.01 Daily Missions

## "Improve by 1% per day, you would have improved 37 times after a year."
「每天進步 1%，一年後就是 37 倍的你」

In mandarin we also say: "滴水穿石", which means slight gradual improvements help reaching our destinations.

This project is to help people keep motivation doing things that make them getting better.  

## Concepts
By completing daily missions, they get one more day of `streak` as motivation

In the future this project will also support peoples' sharing of their current status, for example their day-streaks and new goals they set.

## Mission types 
There are two kinds of missions in this project: 
1. `Fixed Missions`: of which the amount or loadings to be completed everyday is fixed.  For example, if someone would like to keep a reading habit for 1 hour per day, they should select this mission type.
2. `Increment Missions`: of which the amount or loadings are increasing at **an increment amount** if the mission is completed that day.  For example, if someone would like to do two more push-ups every next day, this kind of mission is for them.

## Frontend
This project relies on [ my other project](https://github.com/Shiou-Ju/daily-mission-angular) for user interface.  

Please refer to link above.

2. Get mission by id
3. Create a mission
4. Update a mission by id
